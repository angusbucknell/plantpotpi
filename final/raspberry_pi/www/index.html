            <h1 class="robo">Aloe Vera</h1><!--Header title, 'robo' class defines new font from Google Fonts via CSS-->
            <p>A. vera is considered to be native only to the south-west Arabian Peninsula. However, it has been widely cultivated 
                around the world, and has become naturalized in North Africa, as well as Sudan and neighboring countries, along with 
                the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and Madeira Islands. It is also naturalized in wild areas across southern Spain, 
                especially in the region of Murcia, being the only place in Europe where it has been found naturalized.
                Aloe vera has been widely grown as an ornamental plant. The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively 
                medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species 
                to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens.
                The species is hardy, and is intolerant of heavy frost or snow.In pots, the species requires well-drained, 
                sandy potting soil and bright, sunny conditions. Aloe plants can burn under too much sun or shrivel when the 
                pot does not drain water. The use of a good-quality commercial propagation mix or packaged "cacti and succulent mix"
                is recommended, as they allow good drainage. Terra cotta pots are preferable as they are porous. Potted plants should 
                be allowed to completely dry before rewatering. When potted, aloes can become crowded with "pups" growing from the sides
                 of the "mother plant".</p>
            <p>Although there is little scientific evidence of the effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extracts for either cosmetic
                or medicinal purposes, the cosmetic and alternative medicine industries regularly make claims regarding the soothing,
                moisturizing, and healing properties of aloe vera.here is no good evidence aloe vera is of use in treating wounds or burns.
                Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an ingredient in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts, but at certain high doses, 
                its toxic properties could be severe when taken orally.
